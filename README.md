<h2>ℹ️ About</h2>
Smart Service is an auto repair shop management application designed to streamline operations for both customers and service personnel. It offers a centralized platform that facilitates scheduling, tracking repairs, and managing invoices, improving the experience for all parties involved. The application includes three roles: admin, mechanic, and user. The administrator can add mechanics and view invoices, the mechanic can manage repairs, and the user can manage their own repairs, view their invoices, and manage their vehicles.

<h2>🛠️ Functionalities</h2>

<strong>Administrator:</strong>
<br>
✅ <strong>Invoice Viewing:</strong> <i>Viewing the status of invoices for all clients, allowing efficient monitoring of all financial transactions.</i>
<br>
✅ <strong>Mechanic Account Management:</strong> <i>Adding mechanics to the platform, thereby controlling the human resources that interact directly with the application and clients.</i>
<br>

<strong>Mechanic:</strong>
<br>
✅ <strong>Managing Repair Status:</strong> <i>Initially, any new repair is automatically set to the status "New." The mechanic can update this status to "In Progress" to indicate that the work is underway. After completion, the status can be changed to "Awaiting Payment".</i>
<br>
✅ <strong>Invoice Generation:</strong> <i>In the "Awaiting Payment" phase, the mechanic is responsible for entering the amount owed by the client and completing the process by changing the status to "Done," officially concluding the repair.</i>
<br>

<strong>User:</strong>
<br>
✅ <strong>Registration and Authentication:</strong> <i>Users can create a new account by providing necessary personal data and authenticate within the application using established credentials. The registration and authentication process is secure, ensuring that access to the application's functionalities is authorized only to individuals with an existing account.</i>
<br>
✅ <strong>Vehicle Management:</strong> <i>Clients can add, edit, and delete vehicles from their account. Deleting a vehicle triggers a cascade deletion of all associated repairs and invoices.</i>
<br>
✅ <strong>Managing Reservations:</strong> <i>Users can create, edit, and cancel reservations. Cancelling a reservation also removes any associated invoice, if one exists for the repair.</i>
<br>
✅ <strong>Viewing Invoices:</strong> <i>Invoice viewing is simplified, allowing users to keep track of their expenses effectively.</i>
<br>
✅ <strong>Editing Profile:</strong> <i>Users can update their personal information to maintain accuracy within the platform.</i>

<h2>👤 Users feedback</h2>

↪ The application was tested by 8 users. Among them, 3 used it on both tablets and phones, while 5 used it only on phones; the entire group later tested the application on desktop or laptop as well. They appreciated the minimalist and easy-to-navigate design of the site. The fact that they could use the application on both smaller screens (phones/tablets) and larger screens (laptop/desktop) without any change in user experience was another strong point.
<br>

↪ In terms of functionalities, users were satisfied. They operated as expected, without causing visual problems or bugs during the application's use. Participants recommended adding new features, such as implementing a feedback system for mechanics and integrating an email notification system.
<br>

<h2>🧑‍🔧 Mechanic feedback</h2>

↪ The mechanic mentioned that for him, the ability to use the application on a phone is a big plus, as he doesn't always have the opportunity to carry a laptop or any other device with a larger screen. He appreciated how quickly he could connect and the convenience of remaining logged into his account, as well as the simplicity of modifying the repair statuses.
<br>

↪ He suggested that in the future, an option to revert to a previous repair status should be added, along with a rescheduling functionality.
<br>

<h2>👨‍💼 Administrator feedback</h2>

↪ The administration expressed great appreciation for the fact that the application can be used on any device while maintaining a consistent user experience. This capability allows administrators to efficiently manage operations and access necessary information in real-time.
<br>

↪ Regarding the application's functionalities, it was noted that for an early-stage application, they are sufficient and usable in a real-world scenario. As future functionalities to implement, it was recommended to create a page where graphical representations of monthly revenues can be viewed, and to integrate with e-factura (the national electronic invoicing system). This integration would consolidate both operational and financial aspects into a single platform. As a result, a new role was identified within the application, that of an accountant, specifically focused on managing the financial side.
